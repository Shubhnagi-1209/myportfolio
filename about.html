            Last year when I entered college I had no idea of what coding or developing means,evryone told to explore. 
            When I looked my fellow batchmates doing Web developing and coding , I also tried it and yes it seems me facinating.

           Till now I have built my own portfolio and started competitive coding and also working on some projects.
        </p>
        <p>
         Outside of coding, I enjoy music, painting,video editing and exploring new places.
         I am also a member of culture club of our college involving filmig and editing , Lights Camera ISM.
